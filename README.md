# stockPrediction-with-Neural_net
I am using a BPN to predict the stock of a certain company using past data . So I take data as csv format and do a few calculation on them after that I get 4 parameters which will the input to the neural net.
the program requires few external lib like numpy,csv,time,math- few of these don't need installation
to install that you need to use pip install numpy and if you use PyCharm then you can also download it from your settings 
I got most of the data from kaggle.com it is a very good place to get information
if you like to improve the code please feel free to do so
